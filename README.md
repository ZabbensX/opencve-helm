# opencve-helm

## DISCLAIMER

This helm chart could to be used in production environments without working registration! Users are managed by admin user which must be created manually. Working ONLY with HTTPS.

## Installation

Prepare self-signed SSL certificate (example.crt) and key (example.key)
```
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -sha256 -days 3650 -nodes -keyout example.key -out example.crt -extensions san -config <(echo "[req]"; echo distinguished_name=req; echo "[san]"; echo subjectAltName=DNS:example.com,DNS:example.net) -subj /CN=example.com
```

Create secret from certificate and key
```
kubectl create secret tls opencve-ssl-secret --key example.key --cert example.crt
```

Download git repository
```
git clone https://github.com/cleveritcz/opencve-helm.git
cd opencve-helm
```

Change host in values.yaml under ingress section from s1.cleverit.cz to your domain where the application will be running.
```
helm install opencve . -n opencve --create-namespace
```

- Check if everything is running except opencve-celery-beat 
```
kubectl get pods -n opencve
```

- Then run these commands:
```
export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace opencve -l "app=webserver" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
kubectl exec -it $POD_NAME -n opencve -- opencve create-user john john.doe@example.com --admin
```

## Caveats

- Please note that the initialization can take several minutes while OpenCVE downloads and imports the CVEs, CPEs and co.
- Even when uninstalling the pvc will remain on the k8s cluster. If you change certain settings (like postgres passwords) you need to delete the pvc manually and let the init container reinitialize it. 

# Uninstallation
```
helm uninstall opencve -n opencve
kubectl delete pvc data-opencve-postgresql-0 -n opencve
```
